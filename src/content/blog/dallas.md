 It is the most populous city in and [seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_seat "County seat") of [Dallas County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_County,_Texas "Dallas County, Texas") with portions extending into [Collin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_County,_Texas "Collin County, Texas"), [Denton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denton_County,_Texas "Denton County, Texas"), [Kaufman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaufman_County,_Texas "Kaufman County, Texas"), and [Rockwall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwall_County,_Texas "Rockwall County, Texas") counties. With a [2020 census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_census "2020 United States census") population of 1,304,379, it is the [ninth-most populous city in the U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population "List of United States cities by population") and the [third-most populous city in Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Texas_by_population "List of cities in Texas by population") after [Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston "Houston") and [San Antonio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio "San Antonio").\[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas#cite_note-:23-12)\[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas#cite_note-13) Located in the [North Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Texas "North Texas") region, the city of Dallas is the main core of the largest metropolitan area in the [Southern United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States "Southern United States") and the largest inland metropolitan area in the U.S. that lacks any navigable link to the sea.\[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas#cite_note-14)

Dallas and nearby [Fort Worth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas "Fort Worth, Texas") were initially developed as a product of the construction of major railroad lines through the area allowing access to [cotton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton "Cotton"), [cattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle "Cattle"), and later [oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum "Petroleum") in [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Texas "North Texas") and [East Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Texas "East Texas"). The construction of the [Interstate Highway System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System "Interstate Highway System") reinforced Dallas's prominence as a transportation hub, with four major interstate highways converging in the city and a fifth interstate loop around it. Dallas then developed as a strong industrial and financial center and a major [inland port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_port "Inland port"), due to the convergence of major railroad lines, interstate highways and the construction of [Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas/Fort_Worth_International_Airport "Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport"), one of the largest and [busiest airports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_airports_by_passenger_traffic "List of busiest airports by passenger traffic") in the world.\[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas#cite_note-handbook_dallas2-15) In addition, Dallas has DART ([Dallas Area Rapid Transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Area_Rapid_Transit "Dallas Area Rapid Transit")) with different colored train lines that transport throughout the Metroplex.\[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas#cite_note-16)

Dominant sectors of its diverse economy include [defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry "Arms industry"), [financial services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services "Financial services"), [information technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology "Information technology"), [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_in_the_United_States "Communications in the United States"), and [transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_in_Dallas "Transportation in Dallas").\[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas#cite_note-17) The Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex hosts 23 [*Fortune* 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500 "Fortune 500") companies, the second-most in Texas and fourth-most in the United States,\[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas#cite_note-:82-18)\[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas#cite_note-:92-19) and 11 of those companies are located within Dallas city limits.\[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas#cite_note-:72-20) [Over 41 colleges and universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_the_Dallas%E2%80%93Fort_Worth_metroplex "List of colleges and universities in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex") are located within its metropolitan area, which is the most of any metropolitan area in Texas. The city has a population from a myriad of ethnic and religious backgrounds and one of the largest [LGBT communities in the U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_United_States "LGBT demographics of the United States")\[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas#cite_note-:02-21)\[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas#cite_note-22) [WalletHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WalletHub "WalletHub") named Dallas the fifth-most diverse city in the United States in 2018.\[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas#cite_note-23)
